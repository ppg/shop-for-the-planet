#Coffee

##TL;DR
Purchase coffee that has earned the <a href="http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/MigratoryBirds/Coffee/criteria.cfm" target="_blank">Bird-Friendly Certification</a>.

##The Problem

>Specifically, the study's authors, led by Shalene Jha of the University of Texas, found that a far larger share of the world's coffee than ever before is now being grown in direct sunlight, rather than under the shade of a canopy of trees. These full-sun coffee farms are scarcely any different from the large plots of monoculture corn and soybeans that have been vilified by environmentalists over the past several decades.

>By contrast, large trees provide a habitat for native wildlife, support soil health, fight erosion and confer side benefits, like fruit and firewood, to farmers. "Our scientists say a certified coffee farm is the next best thing to rainforest," Chris Wille, the head of sustainable agriculture at Rainforest Alliance, said of shaded farms.

>"The expansion of coffee that we've seen in the last two decades has largely been in places where coffee is grown in this low-shade, very intensive style, where there are no overstory trees," Jha said. "And in this manner of production, the coffee really doesn't last very long, and it really degrades the environment."

<blockquote>
The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center (SMBC) gives this certification to farmers in order to promote shade-grown organic coffee plantations that can play a key role in the conservation of our global environment and of migratory birds that find sanctuary in these forest-like plantations. Bird-friendly certification was one of the early environmentally oriented certification schemes for coffee and helped to establish the environmental standards now used by other certifications. It emerged as a response to the studies showing dramatic declines in North American migratory bird species, which were correlated to the shrinking wintering habitats for these species in the tropics. These studies showed that shade-grown coffee plantations in Central and South America were important refuges for migratory birds. The criteria for shade in this certification program are more detailed than those of the Rainforest Alliance program. Bird-friendly certification requires at least 11 species of canopy trees per hectare and the main canopy must be at least 40 feet tall. Additionally, the production area must have at least a 40 percent foliage cover that forms three forest layers, and the coffee must be organic certified.
